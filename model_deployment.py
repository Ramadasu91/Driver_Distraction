    ## Business Overview

    You're probably wondering why this APP? Well, road safety remains a critical concern around the world, with distracted driving claimed as being a leading cause of accidents. Distracted driving accounts for at least **9%** of annual car accidents in USA and is the leading cause of accidents worldwide.  

    According to an NTSA report on accidents in 2023, **1,072** people were killed on our roads, with the main causes being drunk driving, speeding and distracted driving. In Kenya we already have measures in place to tackle the first two: Alcoblow for drunk-driving, speed guns and speed governors for speeding. There seems to be nothing in place to tackle the third cause and that is where our project comes in.  

    This project aims to leverage computer vision and machine learning techniques to develop a system capable of detecting distracted drivers in real-time, contributing to enhanced road safety measures.

    ## Problem Statement

    Distracted driving poses significant risks, including accidents, injuries, and fatalities. Identifying and mitigating instances of distraction while driving is crucial to reducing road accidents.  

    The ballooning of car insurance claims led Directline Insurance, Kenya, to engage us in this project, with a vision to lower the rising claims from their customers.
